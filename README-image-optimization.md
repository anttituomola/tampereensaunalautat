# Image Optimization Guide

Your Vercel usage was high due to large, unoptimized images. This guide explains the optimizations implemented and how to use them.

## 🚨 Current Problem
- Many images are 300KB-1.4MB each (`elamyslaiva_roosa7.jpg` is 1.4MB!)
- Some boats have 12+ images in carousels
- All served through Vercel edge functions, consuming your plan limits

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Image Compression Scripts
Created automated scripts to compress your images:

```bash
# Install the required Sharp dependency
npm install

# Optimize all images (creates optimized versions)
npm run optimize-images

# After reviewing optimized images, replace originals
npm run replace-images
```

**Expected Results:**
- 60-80% reduction in file sizes
- 1.4MB images → ~280-400KB
- Maintains visual quality at 82% JPEG quality

### 2. Enhanced Next.js Configuration
- Added AVIF format support (even better compression than WebP)
- Increased cache TTL to 1 year
- Set quality to 80% for better compression
- Added proper compression headers

### 3. Better Lazy Loading
The existing code already uses Next.js Image component correctly with:
- Proper `sizes` attributes
- Lazy loading for non-priority images
- Image preloading for carousels

## 📊 Expected Impact

**Before optimization:**
- Average image: 500KB-1.4MB
- Total images: ~80 images × 500KB avg = 40MB
- User loads gallery page: Downloads 5-10MB

**After optimization:**
- Average image: 100-300KB
- Total images: ~80 images × 150KB avg = 12MB
- User loads gallery page: Downloads 1-3MB
- **70-80% reduction in data transfer**

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Optimize images:**
   ```bash
   npm run optimize-images
   ```

3. **Review the optimized images** in `public/images-optimized/`

4. **Replace original images:**
   ```bash
   npm run replace-images
   ```

5. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Optimize images for better Vercel performance"
   git push
   ```

## 🔍 Monitoring Results

After deploying, monitor your Vercel dashboard:
- **Edge Requests**: Should see fewer image requests due to better caching
- **Data Transfer**: Should see 70-80% reduction in outgoing data
- **Page Load Speed**: Should improve significantly

## 🛡️ Backup & Safety

- Original images are backed up to `public/images-backup/`
- You can restore them anytime if needed
- Scripts are non-destructive until you run `replace-images`

## 📈 Future Optimizations

If you still need more optimization:

1. **External CDN**: Move images to Cloudinary or similar
2. **Progressive Loading**: Load only visible images
3. **Thumbnail Generation**: Create smaller preview versions
4. **Format Detection**: Serve AVIF to supporting browsers

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Script fails?**
- Make sure Node.js is updated
- Check file permissions on images directory

**Images look too compressed?**
- Adjust quality in `scripts/optimize-images.js` (line 26)
- Re-run optimization

**Want to revert?**
- Copy files from `public/images-backup/` back to `public/images/`
